1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,390

2
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,310
OK.

3
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:06,150
The next step for us is
to install bottle.py.

4
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:07,870
This is the web framework we're
going to use to build

5
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:09,150
the blogging software.

6
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,010
If you're a Mac user, and
you've already installed

7
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,430
Bottle in the previous
segment, you

8
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:13,790
can skip this part.

9
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:15,920
This is for Windows
users only.

10
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,850
So I've gone into Google and
I've typed bottle.py into the

11
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:21,230
Google search engine.

12
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:24,240
And I'm going to click on
the first link here.

13
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,290
The first thing you notice is
that it says, this is a

14
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:28,790
preview release of 0.12 dev.

15
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:30,660
So where is the stable
release?

16
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,500
Well, if we go down here,
it says, stable release.

17
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,960
Ah, stable release.

18
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,660
And it makes the suggestion that
I would download it and

19
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:43,000
install it by running
easy_install, minus U, bottle.

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,650
But if you try that, you'll
quickly find out that you do

21
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:50,840
not have easy_install installed
on your Windows

22
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,750
machine because you do
not have setup tools.

23
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,240
So how do you get the setup
tools that will give you the

24
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,720
easy install that would let
you install Bottle?

25
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:05,519
Well, "download setup tools."
And when I did that in my

26
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,820
Google search engine--

27
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:08,080
Now, this was customized
to me.

28
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,710
So you might see slightly
different results.

29
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:11,720
But you need to go right here.

30
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,230
And it makes some suggestions
for how you're going to get

31
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:16,690
setup tools, which is going
to give you easy_install.

32
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:19,380
You probably have a 32-bit
version of Python, even if you

33
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:20,330
have a 64-bit machine.

34
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,590
Because it does run
32-bit binaries.

35
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:25,350
They suggest that you run
the .exe installer.

36
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:26,770
And so we will do that.

37
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:28,010
We'll go down.

38
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:31,730
And we are running Python 2.7.

39
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:33,390
That's what we downloaded
before.

40
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:35,700
So we're going to go for this
installer right here.

41
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,640
And now I'm going to run that.

42
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,220
And I'm going to agree
to the terms.

43
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,030
I'm going to say yes,
absolutely.

44
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,180
I would like to.

45
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,760
Oh, by the way, it said that
my Python executable is in

46
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,200
Python 2.7.

47
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,470
And it's going to put this stuff
in lib site-packages.

48
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:51,990
So that's fine.

49
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,400
Now I'm going to install it.

50
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,010
And now I am finished.

51
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:58,870
So I'm going to now go back
to my other window

52
00:01:58,870 --> 00:01:59,660
and see what it said.

53
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:03,190
It said, "easy_install
-U bottle." OK.

54
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:06,125
Well, let's go and get a new
window, see if easy_install is

55
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:07,440
in my path now.

56
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,190
It's not.

57
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,389
It's in the Python directory.

58
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:15,620
So let's just go into there, cd
slash, cd Python 27, cd--

59
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,190
what did it say?

60
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,135
Scripts, I think.

61
00:02:17,135 --> 00:02:18,720
So that's going to put
it in Scripts.

62
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,830
So I'm going to go into
the Scripts directory.

63
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,320
And there it is.

64
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,650
There is easy_install.

65
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:26,020
So I'm going to do
easy_intall, dot

66
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,280
exe, minus U, bottle.

67
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:28,880
OK.

68
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,430
That is great.

69
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:33,550
So now Bottle is installed.

70
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,370
And what version
did it install?

71
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:39,180
It said it had installed
version 0.11.3.

72
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,860
And going back to the page, that
is the stable release.

73
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,360
So we are happy with that.

74
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,910
So that is the way you
get Bottle installed.

75
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:51,990
And then in the next segment,
you can confirm it works using

76
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:54,840
the same Hello World program
that you use on a Mac.

77
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,880
It will work on both
platforms.

78
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,130
OK.
