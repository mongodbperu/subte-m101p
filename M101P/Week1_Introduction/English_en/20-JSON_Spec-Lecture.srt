00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,430
If you want to know more about
JSON, JSON is a standard.

3
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:07,000
And you can look it up
at www.json.org.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,150
And this document over here,
this webpage, shows you JSON.

5
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:12,830
It's the same as I've told you
about, but there's some slight

6
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:14,790
different nomenclature
that I'll go through.

7
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,570
So rather than call it a
document at the highest level,

8
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:18,890
they call it an object.

9
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:22,170
And you can see that an object,
or document, can have

10
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:26,050
an arbitrary number of keys and
values and a colon between

11
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:27,280
the key and the value.

12
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,330
And then there's a comma between
each set of them.

13
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:32,610
And then the value can be a
bunch of different things.

14
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,540
If you go down the page, you
can see a value can be a

15
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:38,950
string, a number, or an object,
or it can be an array.

16
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:42,170
And then an array right
here is explained.

17
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:45,520
An array is just the sequence
of values that are separated

18
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,690
by a comma.

19
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:49,540
So this is essentially a more
formal representation of what

20
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:50,810
we've been talking about.

21
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:52,570
But you can see that this
standard allows for an

22
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:56,890
arbitrary nesting of arrays
and documents, or objects,

23
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,190
within the array.

24
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:00,720
And the value can be either an
array or another document.

25
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,270
And you can create these data
structures that are quite

26
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,840
complex and that map pretty
well to what you might see

27
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,090
inside your code.
