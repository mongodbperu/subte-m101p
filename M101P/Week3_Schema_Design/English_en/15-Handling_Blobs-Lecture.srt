1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,180

2
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,450
Now I'd like to talk to
you about GridFS.

3
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:05,980
If you want to store large files
inside MongoDB, you're

4
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:10,880
limited by the document size
limit of 16 megabytes.

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,570
But, MongoDB has a special
facility called GridFS, that

6
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,490
will break up a large
file into chunks.

7
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:21,030
And store those chunks
in a collection.

8
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:24,640
And it will also store metadata
about these chunks in

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,440
a secondary collection.

10
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,820
So, you have a collection that
tells you about the chunks and

11
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,690
then a bunch of chunks that
are stored within MongoDB.

12
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,320
So how does that work?

13
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,770
Well, let's take a look.

14
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:40,270
I have a video file that
is too big to be

15
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:41,560
stored inside a document.

16
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,560
It's about 100 megabytes.

17
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,410
And it won't store easily
inside MongoDB.

18
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:48,890
And we can see this
file right here.

19
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:50,260
Let's look at it.

20
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,660
And there it is at
100 megabytes.

21
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:53,680
So what do we do?

22
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,340
Well, I've written a program
called using GridFS, that's

23
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:01,850
going to store that file
inside MongoDB.

24
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:03,300
So here's how it works.

25
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,690
We get a connection to
the test database.

26
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:09,610
And we have our own metadata
collection that we create

27
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:11,250
called, videos_meta.

28
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,230
We don't need that, but I just
wanted to store information

29
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,820
about everything I stored
into the database.

30
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:21,110
And then I get a new order
pointer to GridFS, giving it

31
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:23,730
the db handle and saying that
I want it to put all those

32
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:26,510
chunks into a collection
called videos.

33
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:29,640
And then I open a file
descriptor in Python to my

34
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,520
video mp4 file.

35
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,530
And I open that up
as readable.

36
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:39,290
And then I get the ID of
a new GridFS file.

37
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:44,340
I put the file into GridFS,
right here, giving it as an

38
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,710
input the file descriptor of the
open file that I want to

39
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:48,490
read off disk.

40
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:50,330
And it returns to me
the underscore ID

41
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:51,620
of the GridFS object.

42
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,780
And then I just close
my incoming object.

43
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,360
And then, just so I can keep
track of stuff, I also store

44
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,270
that ID that I got from GridFS
into that collection that

45
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,690
referenced up here, called
videos_meta.

46
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:05,450
I just insert that ID and
the file name, so I

47
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:06,810
know what it is.

48
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,759
So let's see what happens
I try to run that.

49
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,740
Python, gridfs, and it's going
to take a few seconds because

50
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:15,060
it writing a hundred
megabyte file.

51
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,250
And there we go.

52
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,770
It says the ID of the file is.

53
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,380
So let's go into Mongo
and see what's there.

54
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,900
So I'm going to run Mongo.

55
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,520
Use the test collection.

56
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,800
Show collections.

57
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,710
All right, I see four different
collections there.

58
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,000
One of them is called
system.indexes.

59
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,620
I'm not going to worry
about that one.

60
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,980
One of them is called
videos_meta.

61
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,760
Now that's the one I created.

62
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,370
So I'm going to look at that.

63
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:39,510
And that tells me that we stored
away the videos that

64
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:45,930
MP4 file and that the grid_id
was this object ID right here.

65
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:48,440
And then, I see two
other collections.

66
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,390
I see videos.chunks
and videos.files.

67
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:55,200
Now videos.chunks is what
MongoDB created with GridFS to

68
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,410
put away this data.

69
00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:00,550
So let's look at the
videos.files collection.

70
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,800
db.videos.files.find.

71
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,490

72
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:08,210
And we can see that it's its own
metadata collection that

73
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:11,530
talks about the object
that it created.

74
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,230
And then the upload date.

75
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:16,080
And then the lengthy object,
which was 100 megabytes.

76
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,280
And then the fact that
it's stored it, I

77
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,970
guess as a md5 hash.

78
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:22,840
It's probably a hash to make
sure that the integrity of

79
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,480
document was not lost
in the translation.

80
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,330
And then, I won't show you those
chunks because they're

81
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:30,840
really big, but I will look at
how many chunks are in there.

82
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,090
So db.videos.chunks.count.

83
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:34,700

84
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,890
And we can see there
are 419 chunks.

85
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,950
And I guess if we want to
look at one we can.

86
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:42,720
Just kind of scrolls
off the screen.

87
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,700
And you can see it's
a bunch of binary

88
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,560
data that's been encoded.

89
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,630
And that's how you use
GridFS if you want

90
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,000
to store large files.

91
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,250
