1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,280

2
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,630
And the answer is it's the
drivers, because the drivers

3
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:03,440
are what's attached mongos.

4
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,870
The mongos' go up and down,
so they can't be the ones

5
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:07,260
responsible for that.

6
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:09,070
And certainly, config servers
don't do that.

7
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:11,300
They're in charge of figuring
out where the chunks are for

8
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,370
the sharding.

9
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:13,620
OK, so that's the answer.
