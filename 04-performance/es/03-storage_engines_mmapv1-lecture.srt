1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,499

2
00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:02,570
Let's talk about the
MMAP storage engine.

3
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:03,675
We call it MMAPV V1.

4
00:00:03,675 --> 00:00:06,220
It's the original storage
engine of MongoDB.

5
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:09,390
And it uses the MMAP system
call under the covers

6
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,980
in order to implement
storage management.

7
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:14,970
Let's look at what the MMAP
system call looks like.

8
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:16,690
It's right here.

9
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:19,750
On any Unix machine,
if you man MMAP,

10
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,530
you'll see that it talks about
allocating memory or mapping

11
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,247
files or devices into
memory, causes the pages

12
00:00:25,247 --> 00:00:27,580
starting address and continuing
for at most length bytes

13
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,663
to be mapped from the
object described by the file

14
00:00:29,663 --> 00:00:31,460
descriptor at an offset.

15
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:33,660
So what does that
really practically mean?

16
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,735
Well, MongoDB needs a
place to put documents,

17
00:00:35,735 --> 00:00:38,210
and it puts the
documents inside files.

18
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:41,050
And to do that, it initially
allocates, let's say,

19
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:41,860
a large file.

20
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:44,560
Let's say it allocates
100 gigabyte file on disk.

21
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,520
So we wind up with 100 gigabyte
file on disk right here.

22
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,814
And this disk may or may
not be physically contiguous

23
00:00:49,814 --> 00:00:52,230
on the actual disk, because
there are some algorithms that

24
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,330
occur beneath that layer that
control the actual allocation

25
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:57,000
of space on a disk.

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,920
But from our standpoint, it's
a 100-gigabyte contiguous file.

27
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,530
If MongoDB calls the
MMAP system call,

28
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:05,500
it can map this file,
this 100-gigabyte file

29
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,974
into 100 gigabytes
of virtual memory.

30
00:01:07,974 --> 00:01:09,390
Now to do that,
of course, we need

31
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:12,790
to be on a 64-bit computer,
because you could never

32
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:14,960
get 100 gigabytes of
virtual memory space

33
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,030
on a 32-bit computer.

34
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,260
You'd be limited to
2 or 4 gigabytes.

35
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,350
And these are all page sized.

36
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:24,350
So pages on an operating system
or either 4K or 16K large.

37
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:27,076
So there's a lot of them
that I'm not showing here.

38
00:01:27,076 --> 00:01:28,450
And the operating
system is going

39
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:30,690
to decide what
can fit in memory.

40
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,030
So if the actual physical
memory of the box is,

41
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,810
let's say, 32
gigabytes, then if I

42
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:39,010
go to access one of the
pages in this memory space,

43
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:41,270
it may not be in memory
at any given time.

44
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:43,597
The operating system
decides which of these pages

45
00:01:43,597 --> 00:01:44,680
are going to be in memory.

46
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,870
I'll just say the green
ones are in memory.

47
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,790
And so when you go
to read a document,

48
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:51,870
if it hits a page that's
in memory, then you get it.

49
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,840
And if hits a page that's not
memory, let's say this page,

50
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,330
then the operating system
has to bring it from disk--

51
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:01,730
this is on disk here-- it has to
bring it from disk into memory

52
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:03,380
before you can access it.

53
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:06,760
And that's the basics of the way
the MMAP storage engine works.

54
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:10,410
Now, the MMAP storage engine
offers collection level

55
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,050
concurrency, or what
we sometimes call

56
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:13,750
a collection level locking.

57
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:17,070
Each collection inside
MongoDB is its own file,

58
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,885
if you look in data/db.

59
00:02:18,885 --> 00:02:20,290
So what that means
is that if you

60
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:22,790
have two different operations
going on at the same time

61
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,365
and they are in the
same collection,

62
00:02:24,365 --> 00:02:26,240
one's going to have to
wait for the other one

63
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,060
if they are write, because
it's a multiple reader,

64
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,750
single writer lock
that it takes.

65
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,980
So only one write
can happen at a time

66
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,159
to a particular collection.

67
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:36,700
But if they're
different collections,

68
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,770
then it could happen
simultaneously.

69
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:40,230
In addition, the
way this storage

70
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:44,635
engine works in MMAP V1, we
allow in-place updates of data.

71
00:02:44,635 --> 00:02:47,260
So if a document is sitting here
in this little page right here

72
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,160
and you do an update
to it, then we'll

73
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,670
try to update it right in place.

74
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,860
And if we can update
it, then what we'll do

75
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,709
is we'll mark it as a
whole, and then we'll

76
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:56,750
move it somewhere else
where there is more space.

77
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,170
So we'll maybe move it
over here or something.

78
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,697
And then we'll
update it over there.

79
00:02:59,697 --> 00:03:01,780
In order to make it more
likely that we can update

80
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,950
a document in place
without having to move it,

81
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:10,820
we use power of two sizes when
we allocate the initial storage

82
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:11,500
for a document.

83
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,130
What that means
is that if you try

84
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:15,780
to create a 3-byte document,
you're going to get 4 bytes.

85
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,515
If you try to create
a 7-byte document,

86
00:03:17,515 --> 00:03:20,640
you're going to get 8
bytes, a 19-byte document,

87
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,760
you're going to get 32 bytes.

88
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,572
And this way, it's
more likely that you

89
00:03:24,572 --> 00:03:26,030
can grow the document
a little bit,

90
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:29,150
and that space that opens
up, that we can re-use it

91
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,480
more easily.

92
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,330
So that's the MMAP
storage engine.

93
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:34,740
And you'll notice that since
the operating system is

94
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,690
what makes the decision about
what is in memory versus what

95
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:39,970
is in disk, we
can't really do much

96
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,720
in terms of controlling that.

97
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,540
The operating system's pretty
smart about managing memory.

98
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,850
So it's usually not
a bad algorithm.

99
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:50,830
But the database doesn't
get to decide or contribute

100
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:54,940
its opinion about what winds up
in physical memory versus what

101
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:55,960
winds up on disk.

102
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,600
And if you're
curious about the way

103
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,180
virtual memory works in general,
just Google virtual memory

104
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,185
and storage systems.

105
00:04:01,185 --> 00:04:02,560
It's the same
algorithms that are

106
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,920
used to manage memory
inside the operating

107
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,900
system for all programs OK.

108
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,590
Now it's time for a quiz.

109
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:11,250
Which of the following
statements about the MMAP V1

110
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,250
storage engine are true?

111
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,420
Check all that apply.

112
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,259
The first is that MMAP offers
document-level locking.

113
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:17,800
The second is that
MMAP automatically

114
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,383
allocates power of
two-sized documents

115
00:04:19,383 --> 00:04:20,870
when new documents are inserted.

116
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:23,453
The third is that MMAP is built
on top of the MMAP system call

117
00:04:23,453 --> 00:04:24,950
that maps files into memory.

118
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,540
And the final one
is that MongoDB

119
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,260
manages the memory
used by each map file,

120
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,360
deciding which parts
to swap to disk.

121
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,340
So check the ones that
you think are correct.
